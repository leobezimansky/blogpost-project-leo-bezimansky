    </h4>
    <p class="body-main"> 
        Garbanguli Berdimuhamedov, Turkmenistan's all powerful and saintlike president,
        is one of many talents. He holds records that make a lot of sense, such as the 
        largest building with triangular marble ornaments, and most landlocked nation.
        He is so talented that he even got filmed riding a bicycle and shooting targets, 
        all without a single missed shot. Even his soldiers were clapping. Coincidently, 
        the president was never ween in the same shot as the impact of the bullet, so the 
        haters say its fake. However, I believe that the President is an expert marksman and
        would never lie to look good.

    </h4>
    <p class="body-main-2"> 
        Garbanguli also has a talent for singing and songwriting. He recently released
        a smash hit and an instant sucess titled "Gurbanguly Mälikgulyýewiç". Yes you read 
        that correctly. This wonderful lyrical miracle is seen by many as the pinnacle of 
        songwriting showing the President's raw skill. A beautiful seance with the sounds and 
        notes coming out of his mouth is the best a human ear can hope for. The lyrics describe
        the splendid state of Turkmenistan, speaking of the "Birds singing down" and how "life
        is so wonderful in Turkmenistan"

    </h4>
    <p class="body-main-3">
        Now there are many great countries on this Earth, but I would argue Turkmenistan
        is onne of the best. Which other place do you know where the ruler is a wonderful
        marksman, a rap god, has an interesting complexion, and had a succesful partnership 
        with America. Turkmenistan is a forgotten country in thhis strange world of ours, 
        and together we can change this. By pledging 100 Turkmen manat (29 US dollars) you 
        can help support the President's singing and songwriting career. By pledging 200 manat 
        you directly fund the entirety of Turkmenistan's sanitation department. By pledging 1000
        or more manat you arent doing anything expect filling Garbanguli's expansive pockets,
        the biggest holy deed of all.
